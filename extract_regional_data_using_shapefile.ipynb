    "# Extracting regional values from Met Office Global meteorological data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "This notebook runs you through how to extract spatial mean values from gridded data using shapefiles. The process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the Shapefile for the regions we want to subset with.\n",
    "2. Determine the full lat-lon extent of the shapefile.\n",
    "3. Use lookup table shapefile_attributes.json to determine what geometry attributes we want to use for this shapefile.\n",
    "4. Use daterange to generate filenames of NetCDFs we want to load\n",
    "5. Load gridded data from NetCDF files into memory using Iris (using [lazy loading](https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/userguide/real_and_lazy_data.html)).\n",
    "6. Subset the data to only the extent of the shapefile, improving the processing time.\n",
    "7. Define the functions to be used in the pipeline.\n",
    "8. Loop through all the regions in the shapefile; subsetting, collapsing and generating a Pandas DataFrame for each region.\n",
    "9. Each DataFrame is saved to CSV in a temporary location.\n",
    "10. Collate all the region DataFrames into one DataFrame and save out to CSV\n",
    "11. Delete the temporary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "This process uses the polygon of a region (from the shapefile) to subset the gridded data by getting the **latitude-longitude bounding box** of the polygon, as described in this diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/coarse_spatial_mean_gridded.png\" alt=\"Lat-Lon bounding box using polygon\" style=\"height: 400px;\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "Each grid cell (small latitude-longitude box) contains a single value for a meteorological variable. The single value of that variable for the whole region/polygon is the mean of all the grid cell values in the bounding box i.e. lat-lon spatial mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we have air temperature values in a bounding box that covers the a polygon. The temperature value for the region is the mean value of the temperatures in the boundind box - 20.9°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/spatial_mean_example.png\" alt=\"The mean value for the temperature is 20.9°C\" style=\"height: 400px;\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time\n",
    "Of course we have ignored the time axis in this example, which is present in the gridded data but is handled for us by the Iris library as just another dimension. In this notebook we use daily data and will simply store the date for each value in the final tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Improvements\n",
    "This process could be more accurate by only using the grid cells which actually overlap with the polygon and by weighting the grid cells according to how much of their area is within the polygon. Improvements like these are coming."
